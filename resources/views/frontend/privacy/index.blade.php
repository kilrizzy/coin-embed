                    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

                    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our websites;</li>
                        <li>Our mobile applications;</li>
                        <li>Our other products, services, and features that are available on or through our websites;
                            and
                        </li>
                        <li>Other users’ websites that use our Services, while you are logged in to your account with
                            us.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we'll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other
                        products and services collectively as “Services.”</p>
                    <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have
                        a separate privacy policy.</p>
                    <p>Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices
                        that you have with respect to that information.</p>
                    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                    <p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our
                        Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>
                    <p>We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically
                        through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we
                        collect.</p>
                    <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
                    <p>It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type
                        of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some
                        examples:</p>
                    <p>Basic Account Information: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your
                        account.</p>
                    <p>Public Profile Information: If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you
                        provide for your public profile.</p>
                    <p>Billing and Contact Information: If you buy something from us –a subscription for example – or
                        pay fees to a site owner (for example via Recurring Payments or Simple Payments), you will
                        provide additional personal and payment information, such as your name, credit card information,
                        and contact information.</p>
                    <p>Content Information: Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information
                        about you in draft and published content. For example, if you write a blog post that includes
                        biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access
                        to the Internet if you choose to publish the post publicly.</p>
                    <p>Communications with Us: You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys,
                        communicate via a support question, post a question about your site in our public forums, or
                        sign up for a newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, comment, or
                        otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by
                        applicable law).</p>
                    <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
                    <p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
                    <p>Log Information: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers,
                        mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address,
                        unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access,
                        operating system, and mobile network information.</p>
                    <p>Usage Information: We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we
                        collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site.</p>
                    <p>Location Information: We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP
                        address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit
                        our Services from certain geographic regions.</p>
                    <h3>Information We Collect from Other Sources</h3>
                    <p>We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into
                        your CoinEmbed account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your website or
                        account to a social media service (like Twitter), we will receive information from that service
                        (such as your username, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization
                        procedures used by that service.</p>
                    <h2>How and Why We Use Information</h2>
                    <h3>Purposes for Using Information</h3>
                    <p>We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:</p>
                    <p>To provide our Services–for example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website,
                        backup and restore your website, charge you for any of our paid Services;</p>
                    <p>To further develop and improve our Services–for example, by adding new features that we think our
                        users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;</p>
                    <p>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which
                        helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</p>
                    <p>To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user
                        retention and attrition — for example, we may analyze how many individuals purchased a paid plan
                        after receiving a marketing message or the features used by those who continue to use our
                        Services after a certain length of time;</p>
                    <p>To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services,
                        detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect
                        the rights and property of Binary Cabin and others, which may result in us declining a
                        transaction or the use of our Services;</p>
                    <p>To communicate with you. For example, we may email you to solicit your feedback, share tips for
                        getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Binary Cabin; text you to verify
                        your payment; or call you to share offers and promotions that we think will be of interest to
                        you. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time.
                        (Please keep in mind that even if you opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating
                        to your account); and</p>
                    <p>To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content recommendations, target our
                        marketing messages to groups of our users, and serve relevant advertisements.</p>
                    <h3>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</h3>
                    <p>A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information
                        about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on
                        the grounds that:</p>
                    <p>(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of
                        service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example,
                        in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or</p>
                    <p>(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or</p>
                    <p>(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person;
                        or</p>
                    <p>(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update
                        our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience;
                        to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the
                        effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor
                        and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or</p>
                    <p>(5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place certain cookies on your device
                        and access and analyze them later on, as described in our Cookie Policy.</p>
                    <h2>Sharing Information</h2>
                    <h3>How We Share Information</h3>
                    <p>We do not sell our users’ private personal information.</p>
                    <p>We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with
                        appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
                    <p>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may disclose information about you to
                        our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need
                        to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information
                        on our behalf.</p>
                    <p>We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy
                        for personal information that we share with them.</p>
                    <p>Legal and Regulatory Requirements: We may disclose information about you in response to a
                        subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to
                        requests for information about CoinEmbed users, please see our Legal Guidelines. Additionally,
                        if you have a domain registered with CoinEmbed, we may share your information to comply with
                        the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers’ (ICANN) regulations, rules, or
                        policies. For example, your information relating to your domain registration may be available in
                        the WHOIS database, or we may be required to share your information with ICANN-approved Dispute
                        Resolution Service Providers. Please see our Domain Registrations and Privacy support document
                        for more details.</p>
                    <p>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others: We may disclose information about you when we believe in
                        good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Binary
                        Cabin, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that
                        there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information
                        related to the emergency without delay.</p>
                    <p>Business Transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all
                        or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Binary Cabin goes
                        out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is
                        transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy
                        Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may
                        continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p>With Your Consent: We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.
                        For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do
                        so, such as the social media services that you connect to your site through our Publicize
                        feature.</p>
                    <p>Aggregated or De-Identified Information: We may share information that has been aggregated or
                        reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you.
                        For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services and we may share
                        a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other
                        platforms.</p>
                    <p>Published Support Requests: And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one
                        of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us
                        clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</p>
                    <h3>Information Shared Publicly</h3>
                    <p>Information that you choose to make public is–you guessed it–disclosed publicly.</p>
                    <p>That means, of course, that information like your public profile, posts, other content that you
                        make public on your website, and your “Likes” and comments on other websites, are all available
                        to others.</p>
                    <p>Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.</p>
                    <h3>How Long We Keep Information</h3>
                    <p>We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the
                        purposes for which we collect and use it — which are described in the section above on How and
                        Why We Use Information — and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.</p>
                    <p>For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Binary
                        Cabin's websites, such as the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for
                        approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other
                        things, analyze traffic to Binary Cabin’s websites and investigate issues if something goes
                        wrong on one of our websites.</p>
                    <h2>Security</h2>
                    <p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you
                        against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do
                        so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>
                    <p>To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security
                        settings, like Two Step Authentication.</p>
                    <h3>Choices</h3>
                    <p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
                    <p>Limit the Information that You Provide: If you have an account with us, you can choose not to
                        provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing
                        information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features
                        of our Services — for example, paid, premium themes–may not be accessible.</p>
                    <p>Limit Access to Information on Your Mobile Device: Your mobile device operating system should
                        provide you with the ability to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or
                        location information via our mobile apps. If you do so, you may not be able to use certain
                        features (like adding a location to a photograph, for example).</p>
                    <p>Opt-Out of Marketing Communications: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from
                        us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of
                        promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your
                        account and legal notices.</p>
                    <p>Close Your Account: If you no longer want to use our Services, you can close your account. Please
                        keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as
                        described in How Long We Keep Information above — for example, when that information is
                        reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as
                        law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.</p>
                    <h3>Your Rights</h3>
                    <p>If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the
                        European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the “GDPR”), data protection laws give you
                        rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law,
                        including the rights to:</p>
                    <p>Request access to your personal data;</p>
                    <p>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</p>
                    <p>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</p>
                    <p>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</p>
                    <p>Request portability of your personal data.</p>
                    <p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and
                        tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to do that, or you would like to contact us about
                        one of the other rights, scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, find out how to reach us.</p>
                    <p>EU individuals also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>
                    <h2>How to Reach Us</h2>
                    <p>If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of
                        the rights mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please contact us at info@binarycabin.com.</p>
                    <h2>Transferring Information</h2>
