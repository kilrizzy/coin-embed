                <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
                <p>These Terms govern your access to and use of CoinEmbed as well as all content and Binary Cabin
                    products and services</p>
                <p>These Terms also govern visitors’ access to and use of any websites that use our Services, such as
                    websites operated by our users.</p>
                <p>Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance, without modification, of all of the terms and
                    conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that may be
                    published from time to time by Binary Cabin (collectively, the “Agreement”). You agree that we may
                    automatically upgrade our Services, and the Agreement will apply to any upgrades.</p>
                <p>Please read the Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any
                    part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Agreement. If you do not agree to all the
                    terms of the Agreement, then you may not access or use our Services.</p>
                <h2>1. Who’s Who</h2>
                <p>Throughout these Terms, “you” applies to both individuals and entities that access or use our
                    Services. If you are an individual using our Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and
                    warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to the Agreement and that by using our
                    Service(s), you are accepting the Agreement on behalf of that entity.</p>
                <h2>2. Your Account</h2>
                <p>Where use of our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate
                    information when you register for an account. This is important because sometimes we may need to
                    send you notable updates (for example, about changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or
                    we may want to let you know about and make informed choices in response to legal inquiries or
                    complaints.</p>
                <p>You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your account. You are
                    responsible for keeping your account information up-to-date and for keeping your password
                    secure.</p>
                <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and any Service-related website,
                    store, or other content, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your
                    account and any other actions taken in connection with our Services. You shall not share or misuse
                    your access credentials. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account,
                    store, or website, or of any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any acts or
                    omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or
                    omissions.</p>
                <p>When you create an account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which
                    means that we may contact you to share more details about what we have to offer. Don’t worry — if
                    you aren’t interested in learning more, you can opt out of the marketing communication, whether it’s
                    an email, phone call, or text message.</p>
                <h2>3. Minimum Age Requirements</h2>
                <p>Our Services are not directed to children. Access to and use of our Services is only for those over
                    the age of 13 (or 16 in the European Union). If you are younger than this, you may not register for
                    or use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to
                    our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older (or 16 years or older in the European
                    Union).</p>
                <h2>4. Responsibility of Visitors and Users</h2>
                <p>We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the content (such as, but not limited to, text,
                    photo, video, audio, code, computer software, items for sale, or other materials) posted to our
                    Services by users or anyone else (“Content”) and are not responsible for any use or effects of such
                    Content. So, for example:</p>
                <p>We do not endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or non-harmful. Content
                    could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical
                    mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual
                    property rights (see our Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy section to submit copyright
                    complaints), or other proprietary rights of third parties.</p>
                <p>If you post Content, comment on a website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make)
                    Content available on our Services, you are entirely responsible for the Content, and any harm
                    resulting from, that Content or your conduct.</p>
                <p>We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from anyone’s use, purchase, or downloading of
                    Content. If you access or use any Content, you are responsible for taking precautions as necessary
                    to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful
                    or destructive content.</p>
                <p>Any Content offered for sale through any of our Services are the seller’s sole responsibility, and
                    you agree that you will look solely to the seller for any damages that result from your purchase or
                    use of Content.</p>
                <p>We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications,
                    transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any Content.</p>
                <p>Please note that additional third party terms and conditions may apply to the downloading, copying,
                    purchase, or use of Content.</p>
                <p>We also have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made
                    available through the websites and web pages that link to, or are linked from our Services. For
                    example:</p>
                <p>We do not have any control over those websites and are not responsible for their contents or their
                    use.</p>
                <p>The existence of a link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse
                    such website.</p>
                <p>You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems
                    from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.
                    We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from non-Binary Cabin websites.</p>
                <h2>5. Fees, Payment, and Renewal</h2>
                <h3>a. Binary Cabin Fees</h3>
                <p>Fees for Paid Services. Some of our Services are offered for a fee, such as CoinEmbed Premium
                    Services (collectively, “Paid Services”). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified
                    fees. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be a one-time fee, recurring fees, or revenue-based
                    fee. For recurring fees, we’ll bill or charge you for in regular automatically-renewing intervals
                    (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at
                    any time by contacting the relevant support team. For revenue-based fees — such as fees for
                    Recurring Payments for your website’s subscriptions — you pay us a percentage of the revenue your
                    website generates. Revenue-based fees are ongoing.</p>
                <p>Taxes. To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are exclusive
                    of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services,
                    harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges now in force or enacted in the future (“Taxes”). You are
                    responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments,
                    or your purchases. If we are obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the Fees you’ve paid or will pay,
                    you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes.</p>
                <p>Payment. If your payment fails or if Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time, we
                    may immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or
                    credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your
                    access to our Services in general.</p>
                <p>Automatic Renewal. To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically
                    renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable
                    subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any
                    payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well
                    as any Taxes). By default, your Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval of time as your
                    original subscription period.</p>
                <p>Cancelling Automatic Renewal. You can manage and cancel your Paid Services at the respective
                    Service’s site.</p>
                <p>Fee Changes. We may change our fees at any time, or start charging fees for Services that were
                    previously free. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don’t
                    agree with the fee changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.</p>
                <p>No-Show Policy. We may have a “no-show policy” for some Paid Services, which means that if you fail
                    to show up or are late for a scheduled session, we may withhold the Service without a refund.</p>
                <p>Refunds. While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion,
                    unless otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
                <h3>b. Fees Collected by Website Owners</h3>
                <p>Fees Paid to Websites or Website Owners. Website owners may choose to sell items (goods, content,
                    services, etc.), offer subscriptions for their websites at specific price points and intervals, or
                    simply collect payments. Please note that we are not involved in a website’s subscription details,
                    or a website’s store operations (including the quality, timing, pricing, or legality of what may or
                    may not be included in exchange for payment, or any goods or services purchased). If you purchase
                    items or subscriptions from a website, your purchase is directly from the website owner, who is
                    solely responsible for the items sold. Please contact the website owner if you have any questions or
                    complaints.</p>
                <p>Automatic Renewal. Any recurring payments you make to a website owner (such as a website
                    subscription) are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel your website subscription
                    before the end of the applicable renewal period, it will automatically renew. Your recurring
                    payments will be renewed for the same interval of time as your original subscription period. For
                    example, for an annual renewal schedule for your website subscription, you will be charged each
                    year. You can view your renewal date by visiting your Other Sites page.</p>
                <p>Refunds. We are not responsible for refunds for fees paid to a website owner because those
                    transactions are between website owners and their users. If you would like to request a refund for
                    any fees paid to a website or website owner, please contact the website owner. If you have a
                    complaint regarding a website owner, you can contact us.</p>
                <h2>6. General Representation and Warranty</h2>
                <p>You represent and warrant that your use of our Services:</p>
                <p>Will be in strict accordance with these Terms;</p>
                <p>Will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, all applicable
                    laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content, privacy, data protection, and the transmission
                    of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside);</p>
                <p>Will not use the Services for any unlawful purposes, to publish illegal content, or in furtherance of
                    illegal activities;</p>
                <p>Will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party;</p>
                <p>Will not overburden Binary Cabin’s systems, as determined by us in our sole discretion;</p>
                <p>Will not disclose sensitive personal information of others;</p>
                <p>Will not be used to send spam or bulk unsolicited messages;</p>
                <p>Will not interfere with, disrupt, or attack any service or network; and</p>
                <p>Will not be used to create, distribute, or enable material that is – or that facilitates or operates
                    in conjunction with – malware, spyware, adware, or other malicious programs or code.</p>
                <h2>7. Specific Service Terms</h2>
                <h3>Prohibited Uses. You agree not to:</h3>
                <p>Modify, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise alter or seek to derive the trade secrets and other
                    inherent intellectual property of Binary Cabin; or
                    License, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, or otherwise
                    commercially exploit or make Binary Cabin services available to any third party, other than your
                    authorized users.</p>
                <p>You should use your best judgment when setting up your website, operating your store, processing
                    payments, and selling items. For example, you may not want to accept check payments if you are not
                    comfortable sharing your mailing address with a customer, or you may want to publish payment and
                    return policies.</p>
                <p>You should use your best judgment when establishing and managing your website’s subscriptions or
                    collecting payments, setting expectations appropriately, and fulfilling any commitments you’ve made.
                    For example, if you’d like to promise your visitors or subscribers a new post each week, but aren’t
                    sure if you’ll be able to post that frequently, you should make it clear that it’s a goal and not a
                    guarantee.</p>
                <p>We are not involved in your relationships or transactions with any customer or potential
                    customer.</p>
                <p>You are responsible for resolving all support questions, comments, and complaints, including refunds,
                    chargebacks, or pricing questions. You should provide contact information so that customers may
                    contact you with questions or complaints.</p>
                <p>You are responsible for delivering items sold to your customers, and for fulfilling all promises,
                    representations, or warranties you make to them in connection with a sale, payment, or website
                    subscription.</p>
                <h2>8. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h2>
                <p>As we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we respect the intellectual property
                    rights of others. If you believe that material located on or associated with a Binary Cabin product
                    or service violates your copyright, please notify us in accordance with Binary Cabin’s Digital
                    Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Policy. We will respond to all such notices, including as required
                    or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing
                    material. We will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of the website if, under appropriate
                    circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other
                    intellectual property rights of Binary Cabin or others. In the case of such termination, we will
                    have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to us.</p>
                <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>The Agreement does not transfer from Binary Cabin to you any Binary Cabin or third party intellectual
                    property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the
                    parties) solely with Binary Cabin. All trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in
                    connection with our Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of Binary Cabin or Binary

                <p>If you purchase a G Suite subscription, this section applies. G Suite is provided by Google, and your
                    use of G Suite is subject to Google’s Terms of Use for the services, which you’ll accept prior to
                    using G Suite for the first time. Binary Cabin is an authorized reseller of G Suite, but makes no
                    warranties about the services provided by Google, and disclaims Google’s liability for any damages

                <h2>12. Changes</h2>
                <p>We are constantly updating our Services and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms
                    under which our Services are offered. These Terms may only be modified by a written amendment signed
                    by an authorized executive of Binary Cabin, or by the posting by Binary Cabin of a revised version.
                    If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by
                    sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will
                    designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree
                    with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period, or
                    once the changes become effective. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new
                    terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including
                    the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.</p>
                <h2>13. Termination</h2>
                <p>We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause,
                    with or without notice, effective immediately. We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in
                    our sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username or website’s URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii)
                    refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any Binary Cabin policy or is
                    in any way harmful or objectionable, (iii) ask you to make some adjustments, restrict the resources
                    your website uses, or terminate your Services, if we believe your website’s storage or bandwidth
                    usage is out of hand and burdens our systems (which is rare and typically only occurs when a website
                    is used for file sharing or storage), or (iv) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our
                    Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund
                    of any amounts previously paid.</p>
                <p>If you wish to terminate the Agreement or your account, you may simply discontinue using our
                    Services, or, if you are using a paid service, you may cancel at any time, subject to the Fees,
                    Payment, and Renewal section in these Terms.</p>
                <p>All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
                    termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity,
                    and limitations of liability.</p>

                    of law provisions. The proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement and
                    any access to or use of our Services will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco
                    County, California.</p>

                    under the Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules
                    of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in
                    accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California, in the
                    English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any
                    action or proceeding to enforce the Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>

                    during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action, whichever is greater. Binary Cabin
                    shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The
                    foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
